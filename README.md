# MSA-Project

My program is a neural network made using Python, and it was trained using images of cats and dogs. When a image is provided, the program will tell you whether the image is of a cat or a dog. Provided that the image is of one or the other. I have provided results from what the output was when I ran it. Sometimes it gets an error but most times its the correct output.
